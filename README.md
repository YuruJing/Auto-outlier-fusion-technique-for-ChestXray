# Auto-outlier-fusion-technique-for-ChestXray
The source code for the paper
There are primary three code files here:
1. Explore and preprocess the non-image data.
2. Preprocessing image data and implement auto-outlier fusion technique.
3. training the model with ResNet-101 architecture with different attention mechanisms' set up and deep generalized max-pooling.
